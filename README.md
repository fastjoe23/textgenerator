# textgenerator

Simple notebook for amazon review generation using tensorflow. We are using a data set of amazon reviews and tensorflow with keras to generate new amazon reviews.

# Tensorflow
Most of the code is very similar from the tensorflow tutorial, see https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation

# Input Data
The amazon reviews are taken from https://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/
But only 2000 reviews are used.
